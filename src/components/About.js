                <p><b>Hello, my name is Loic Cardinal Hirwa</b>.
                I am a software developper, I started to know this
                field when I was young but I started digging in it 
                in 2019 when I found out that this field is very 
                intersting, helpful and enjoyable. That's why I 
                took a decision of empowering future software 
                developpers and feel confident every single day
                in this field.</p>
